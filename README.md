# PseudoLocalizer

> Pseudolocalization (or pseudo-localization) is a software testing method used for testing internationalization aspects of software. Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language, as in the process of localization, the textual elements of an application are replaced with an altered version of the original language.

## Why?

IBM suggests that on average, we should expect any English string to inflate by 30% when translating in another language. Using pseudo localization is a way to simulate translation of English UI strings, without waiting for, or going to the effort of doing real translation. Think of it as a fake translation that remains readable to an English speaking developer, and allows them to test for translation related expansion.
